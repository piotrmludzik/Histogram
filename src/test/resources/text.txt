Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.
Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?
Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.

Okay.
This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.
Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.
Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?
Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.
You're gonna be in the car with her.
What, what, ma?
Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Crazy drunk drivers.
You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too.
Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.
Yeah, it's 8:00.
I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.
On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.
